====  DateTime Extensions ====
---------------------------------------

This project is a merge of several common DateTime operations on the form of 
extensions to System.DateTime, including natural date difference text (precise and human rounded),
holidays and working days calculations on several culture locales.

Feedback will be much appreciated.

You can check out a sample (WIP) project online on http://datetimeextensions.apphb.com/

Major Features
---------------------------------------

Currently implemented are the following major features:
- Add or subtract Working days using locale holidays
- Export Holidays to calendar format
- Dates Difference in Natural Time (localized)
- Time of day
- General "goto" dates


Working Days Calculations
---------------------------------------

This extensions for System.DateTime adds methods to make calculations based on working days.
A working day is defined in IWorkingDayCultureInfo in two ways:
- IsWorkingDay(DayOfWeek dayOfWeek)
- IsWorkingDay(DateTime date)

The first defines witch day of the week is a working day (by default, working days are all 
week days except weekends). The last does the same as the first, but it's also able to check 
for any holiday. By default, no holidays are defined, unless there is a IWorkingDayCultureInfo 
implemented for the current thread CultureInfo.

Avaiable CultureInfo implementations:
- pt-PT		- da-DK
- pt-BR		- fi-FI
- en-US		- is-IS
- en-GB		- nb-NO
- fr-FR		- nl-NL
- de-DE		- sv-SE
- es-ES		- es-AR
- es-MX		- en-AU
- en-ZA		- fr-CA (en-CA)
- ar-SA		- it-IT

your culture is not listed here? you can contribute it!!! 
Fork me, implement it and send me the pull request, or just create an issue on the project github site. 


Export Holidays to calendar format
---------------------------------------

This feature allows you to export the holidays from a DateTimeCultureInfo (see above)
and export it to Microsoft Office Outlook.
The IExportHolidaysFormat interface exposes one simple method for it:
- void Export(DateTimeCultureInfo dateTimeCultureInfo, int year, TextWriter writer)

Example:
var exporter = ExportHolidayFormatLocator.LocateByType(ExportType.OfficeHolidays);
exporter.Export(new WorkingDayCultureInfo("pt-PT"), 2012, textwriter);


Dates Diff in Natural Time
---------------------------------------

This extensions can compare two dates in natural language based on the current locale on 
current thread CultureInfo.
There are 2 API points for them:
- fromDate.ToNaturalText(toTime, bool round = true)
- fromDate.ToExactNaturalText(toTime)

The first will return the most valuable time component with value > 0. The round flag will 
try to round the most significant time component based on the next least significant. 
Also, the round flag will round minutes and seconds to quarters after the first one.

Avaiable CultureInfo implementations:
- pt-PT
- pt-BR
- en-US
- en-GB
- fr-FR
- de-DE
- es-ES
- nl-NL
- nl-BE


Time of Day
--------------------------------------

This extensions allows to easily parse time expressions and check if a DateTime instance is after,
before or inside a period.

- bool IsBetween(this DateTime dateTime, Time startTime, Time endTime)
- bool IsBefore(this DateTime dateTime, Time time)
- bool IsAfter(this DateTime dateTime, Time time)


Other Extensions:
---------------------------------------

fromDate.FirstDayOfTheMonth()
fromDate.LastDayOfTheMonth()
fromDate.LastDayOfWeek(DayOfWeek)
fromDate.NextDayOfWeek(DayOfWeek)
fromDate.LastDayOfWeekOfTheMonth(DayOfWeek)
fromDate.FirstDayOfWeekOfTheMonth(DayOfWeek)
fromDate.GetDiff(DateTime toDate)
